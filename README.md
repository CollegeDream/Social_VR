# VR for Social Simulation Project

## Description
The VR Project is a project started in the Spring 2024 semester of Software Engineering CS472, in which we are aiming to develop a program that can be used to practice social interactions. While the main group of users will be children with social disorders, anyone can be a potential user. This is intended to be continued past Spring 2024, with other student developers taking on the project.

The goal of the project will be for users to choose the flow of the simulation by selecting from multiple options for different actions they can take. The simulation will be interactions in the HUB and dining hall with both 1-on-1 interactions and group interactions for the user to practice and gain confidence in multiple settings.

The project was primarily spearheaded by Dr. Vicky Tsang, Associate Professor in the School of Health Sciences. The project has academic and research applications, so certain data will be collected while the user is in the simulation. The Quest Pro VR headset includes tracking eye movements, facial expressions, body motions, and hand gestures. We aim to determine the parameters for the data collection and to synthesize the data into a comprehensible presentation for the user and other researchers, such as Dr. Tsang. 

## Description of items found in this repository
### Development Notes
For future developers working on the project, `DevelopmentNotes.md` contains steps for installing necessary software and processes we used. Other notes or tips we discover are also in the document.

### `development_notes_images` Folder
This is where we stored images we reference in our development notes so that it is clearer easier to understand.

### `neural_network_` Folder
This is where all the files and scripts related to developing the neural network for facial recognition is stored.

### `presentation_materials` Folder
Powerpoint and PDF format of the slideshow we used to present in Senior Software Engineering CS472 in Spring 2024.

### `VR_Script_Solo_Revise` Document
This is the script we've written as the initial scenario for users to practice in. It includes 1-on-1 interactions with different people in the HUB.

### `defaultREADME.md` File
This is the default github README file, which we have not added to but kept in case we needed to reference something.
